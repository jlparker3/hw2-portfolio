# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Resposive Portfolio

This project allowed us to express our creativity in designing three pages of our very own website. The three pages were titled 'index.html' 'contact.html' 'portfolio.html'. A portfolio page is neccessary to any future employment in the web development industry. Each page is responsive to different page views, whether it might be seen from a phone, tablet, or laptop. This is accomplished through using the Bootstrap Grid system of rows and columns. 


## Pages

# Index

* Within 'index.html' I added a image of myself and a short bio about my life and what brought me on this coding journey. 

# Contact

* Within 'contact.html' I used Bootstrap to provide three input options for a name, email, and message. I also added links to my three of my social media accounts Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. 

# Portfolio

* Within 'portfolio.html' I made a grid to hold five 350x350 placeholders and as I gain coding experience I will update the placeholders with projects.
