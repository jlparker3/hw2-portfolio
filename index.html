                <p> Hi there, my name is Jessica Parker. I am enrolled in Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. On top of being a
                  bootcamp student, I currently work in Surgical Pathology in a hospital setting. During the coronavirus
                  pandemic, I found myself with a fair amount of free time. I decided to pick up coding out of curiosity. Soon
                  after I discovered how much one could truly do with the power of code, it amazed me. I began drafting ideas
                  for websites and applications that would help communities in various ways. With the support of my family I
                  decided to go down this path that will open endless opportunities. I have always had a passion for helping
                  others and I thought health care was the only field for me. Empowering individuals with the tools to improve
                  their lives on a daily basis is the core reason why I am attending this bootcamp. I wish to learn as much as
                  possible to be able to provide knowledge and support to small businesses, to over seen communities, to a
                  more inclusive well rounded version of the internet.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>I moved from Mississippi to Chicago to mold my life the way I wished for as a little girl. Today, I have
             built a family with my partner and my two cats Milo and Luna. With hopes to expand our family in the near
             future. I want to show my children by example, that if you work hard and are dedicated to the cause you can
             make amazing things happen. With this career, I will have to ability to empower lives all around the globe
             and that's all I need in life.</p>
